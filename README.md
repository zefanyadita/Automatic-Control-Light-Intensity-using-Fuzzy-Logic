# Automatic-Control-Light-Intensity-using-Fuzzy-Logic

### Project 
- Automatic Light Intensity Control with Fuzzy Logic is an automatic regulation system that uses fuzzy logic (Tsukamoto) principles to control the brightness level or intensity of lights.
- This automation system helps in optimizing energy use by regulating light intensity according to environmental conditions. Efficient use of electricity in lighting can bring economic, environmental and comfort benefits to users.
